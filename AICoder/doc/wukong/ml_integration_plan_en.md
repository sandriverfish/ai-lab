# Wukong Machine Learning Integration Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating machine learning capabilities into the Wukong V1.0 system to enhance its product recognition robustness, reduce sensitivity to positioning and lighting variations, and decrease the amount of training data required for new products.

### 1.1 Current System Limitations

The current V1.0 system relies primarily on template matching using OpenCV, which has the following limitations:
- Strict requirements for product positioning
- High sensitivity to lighting conditions
- Limited adaptability to product variations
- Requires extensive manual configuration for new products
- Difficulty distinguishing similar components

### 1.2 Integration Goals

The ML integration aims to achieve the following goals:
- Improve recognition accuracy under varying conditions (position, lighting)
- Reduce the amount of training data required for new products
- Maintain or improve the current recognition speed (target: <100ms per component)
- Provide a smooth transition path from V1.0 to V2.0
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing configurations

## 2. Technical Approach
